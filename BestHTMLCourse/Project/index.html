        A <em style="background-color: #1a89171a"> wonderful </em> serenity has
        taken possession of my entire soul, like these sweet mornings of spring
        which I enjoy with my whole heart. I am alone,
        <br />
        and feel the charm of existence in this spot, which was created for the
        bliss of souls like mine. I am so happy, my dear friend, <br />
        so absorbed in the exquisite sense of mere tranquil existence, that I
        neglect my talents.
      </p>

      <p>
        I should be incapable of drawing a single stroke at the present moment;
        and yet I feel that I never was a greater artist than now. <br />
        When, while the lovely valley teems with vapour around me, and
        <em style="background-color: #1a89171a">
          the meridian sun strikes the upper surface of the impenetrable foliage
          of my trees,</em
        >
        <br />
        and but a few stray gleams steal into the inner sanctuary exquisite
        sense of mere tranquil existence, that I neglect my talents.

      <h2>
        What is Lorem Ipsum?
      </h2>
      <p>
        A <em style="background-color: #1a89171a"> Lorem Ipsum </em> is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. 
        <br>It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
